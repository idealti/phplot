This file contains information about a PHPlot Subversion branch for Release 6.
Updated: 2012-05-08

This branch contains code that is currently experimental and possibly
broken. It represents work in progress towards PHPlot-6.0.0. There may be
significant changes in functions and usage before release, so don't rely on
anything here for anything important.


Note added: 2012-09-17

This branch contains code (phplot/) and documentation (phplotdocs/) for
Release 6.0.0. It does not contain tests. New tests for the new release
are being committed to the trunk (/trunk/phplottest) instead of the
branch. Most of the new tests will fail with pre-6.0.0 releases of
PHPlot. That isn't a problem, since the only testing of already-released 
PHPlot versions is for testing PHPlot-5.8.0 with new PHP releases, and
this compares results with previously saved results, ignoring new tests.

If necessary, /tags/Test-20120412/phplottest has the test suite as it was
when PHPlot-5.8.0 was released.
